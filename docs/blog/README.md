# The Blog

The following is a series of blog posts which provide insight into the thinking behind the Flips library and the design choices that were made along the way. My hope is that these provide historical context for decisions and a documentation of the good and bad choices that were made. Much can be learned from watching someone struggle through the design of the library. Seeing ideas form over time gives better appreciation for just how difficult it can be. I want future library authors to see the mistakes that were made and how they were corrected. I want others to learn from my mistakes so they can make even better tools.
